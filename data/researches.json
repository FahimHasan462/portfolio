        "description": "We introduce a refined CD-MAWS method for phylogeny estimation, significantly reducing computational complexity from max(O(m^n), O(m^n log n)) to max(O(m^n), O(mnk)) while maintaining tree quality. Here, m is the number of species, n is the size of DNA of a species, and k is the maximum MAW length. This advancement is achieved through a revised cosine distance calculation method, binary encoding of MAWs, and the adoption of suffix automata for MAW generation, addressing the main computational bottleneck and setting a better runtime for alignment-free phylogenetic analysis"
